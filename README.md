# C Hybrid PQC Demo with Unity

A professional C library demonstrating **hybrid classical + post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**, complete with **modular library structure, unit tests, and a working demo program**. This project 
is designed to showcase clean **C project organization**, **unit testing with Unity**, and a simple **PQ crypto use case**.

--- 

## Features

- Memory-safe code: Zero leaks confirmed with Valgrind / AddressSanitizer

- Modular C library design (`.h` / `.c`)  
- PQC-inspired keypair generation and encryption simulation  
- Hybrid classical + PQC handshake demonstration  
- Unit testing using [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity)  
- Demo program simulating a hybrid handshake for real-world style use  
- Build system via **Makefile**

**Key takeaways for developers and recruiters:**

1. **Library structure in C** â€” separates interface (`.h`) and implementation (`.c`) files.  
2. **Unit testing professional workflow** â€” automated tests using Unity for function correctness.  
3. **Post-quantum crypto use case** â€” simulates hybrid classical + PQC handshake, illustrating cryptographic reasoning.

## Build & Test

Compile the library and run unit tests:

```bash
make
make test


Expected output:

tests/test_pq.c:27:test_generate_keypair:PASS
tests/test_pq.c:28:test_encrypt_message:PASS
tests/test_pq.c:29:test_hybrid_shared_secret:PASS

-----------------------
3 Tests 0 Failures 0 Ignored 
OK

Demo Program

Run the hybrid handshake demo:

gcc -Iinclude -Wall -std=c11 demo/hybrid_handshake.c src/pq.c -o demo/hybrid_handshake
./demo/hybrid_handshake


Expected output (numbers will vary):

=== Hybrid Handshake Demo ===

Classical key: 42
PQC public key: 873
PQC private key: 129
Hybrid shared secret (classical + PQC): 915
Encrypting message 'HELLO PQC' with PQC key: 5970

Demo complete.
