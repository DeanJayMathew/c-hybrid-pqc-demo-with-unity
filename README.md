# C Hybrid PQC Demo with Unity

A professional C library demonstrating **hybrid classical + post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**, complete with **modular library structure, unit tests, and a working demo program**. This project 
is designed to showcase clean **C project organization**, **unit testing with Unity**, and a simple **PQ crypto use case**.

--- 

## Features

- Memory-safe code: Zero leaks confirmed with Valgrind / AddressSanitizer

- Modular C library design (`.h` / `.c`)  
- PQC-inspired keypair generation and encryption simulation  
- Hybrid classical + PQC handshake demonstration  
- Unit testing using [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity)  
- Demo program simulating a hybrid handshake for real-world style use  
- Build system via **Makefile**

**Key takeaways for developers and recruiters:**

1. **Library structure in C** â€” separates interface (`.h`) and implementation (`.c`) files.  
2. **Unit testing professional workflow** â€” automated tests using Unity for function correctness.  
3. **Post-quantum crypto use case** â€” simulates hybrid classical + PQC handshake, illustrating cryptographic reasoning.
